# Sum till 'n'

## sum(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)....(n)() should give me the output of 1+2+3+4+5+....+n

```
Write a function which takes one argument 'n' and calculate the sum as asked in the above statement.
Execution/Invocation of the main function will happen only once and the inner sum function will be invoced 'n' times and will give the output at the end.
